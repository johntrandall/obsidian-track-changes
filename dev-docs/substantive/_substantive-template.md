> Written by `watchbill decide` from the card's fields on every write (what he is looking at, the exact action, what happens next); never edited by hand.

## The question

[fill in: one plain question, phrased so that yes accepts the recommendation; no double negatives]

**Why:** [fill in: the problem this solves: why he might want it, in a sentence]

## Why this is being asked

**Start here.** [fill in: what this is about, for a reader coming to it cold a month from now, and what waits on the answer; how it arose goes in History]

**Terms.**
- [fill in: every term, id, acronym, seat name and file this card uses, defined before it is used]

## Design impact

[fill in: for each document, tool or seat the answer changes: its link, what it says or does today, what it will say or do after a yes; or `No design change:` and the reason]

[fill in, when the card proposes or changes a field, switch, flag or setting: a section here laying each out, for example:]

**`the_field`**
  - *What it is:* [fill in]
  - *Values:*
    - `value_a`: [fill in: what it does, what it allows, when to use it]
    - `value_b`: [fill in]
  - *Who reads it:* [fill in]
  - *Default:* [fill in]

**Binds:** [fill in: the seats whose behaviour changes] · **Your part:** [fill in: what he does after a yes, blocking or queued; or nothing new; when it changes a gate or a field, the steward's records step comes before the landing] · **Does not change:** [fill in: what a reader might assume changes]

## Options and consequences

Any number of options, combinations allowed; each labelled recommended, fallback, viable or not viable, with the reason. A simple yes/no card needs only yes and no.

- **yes** ([fill in: recommended, fallback, viable or not viable]): [fill in: what happens, what it costs, what undoing it would cost, and why it has that label]
- **no** ([fill in: label]): [fill in: what happens, what it costs, what undoing it would cost]

## Recommendation

**[fill in: one option, or yes/no; never a no: invert the question instead].** [fill in: the reason, in a sentence or two; what the seat does on a yes]

## History

[fill in: how the question arose, at most five lines: the human's words verbatim with the time and the channel; earlier rounds; who was consulted]

## Links

- [fill in: every document that bears on it, each labelled with what it is]

## The human's words

## Talk to the agent

## Card log

One line per edit: when, who (name, role, session), what.

## John's comments

Type under the last *John* heading, or answer in chat; drag the card to **revise** when you want the agent to act on what you wrote.
