# intake

An intake note: what an outsider drops in a system's intake folder before ringing its doorbell (`watchbill:intake`). The schema above is the rule; the receiving seat writes `processed`. The fleet's event kinds are `release`, `rename`, `correction`, `request`, `finding` and `proposal`; a system whose contracts define others (a hand-off kind, with the fields its contract names) uses them as they are: `event` is any word and other fields are allowed (0.10.43: the shipped type forbade both, and a system's first `systems init` installed a gate that refused every one of its own records). To pin a system's kinds or fields, edit this file in the system (it is the architect's); the plugin never rewrites it once written.
