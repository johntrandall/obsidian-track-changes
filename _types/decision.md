# decision (substantive)

One substantive decision for the human, tied to no item (ADR-0001): a file in `dev-docs/substantive/`, the `_substantive.base` kanban as the view, `human_*` fields the human's alone. Shipped by the watchbill plugin (`watchbill systems init`); `watchbill decide` writes these records.

`_human_verdict` is a lane (0.10.50, `references/decisions.md`, "The lanes"): the human's (`snoozed`, `yes, show me`, `yes, just do it` (0.10.68: the two flavours of yes; a plain `yes` is read as `yes, show me` for one release and `--refresh-bases` migrates it), `no`, `revise proposal`, `revise card`, `later`, `after POC`, `after MVP`, `talk`, or one of the card's own `options`) or the agent's (`documents to review`, `new decisions`, `returning decisions`, `agents drafting`, `agent working`, `agent waiting`, `agent scheduled`, `processed`, `agent editing` (0.10.67: held while an agent writes a card from his lanes; `editing_from` keeps the lane it goes back to)), so the schema takes any string and `watchbill decide` checks a verdict against the card's options. An agent writes the field only through the `watchbill decide` verbs, which keep the human's verdict in `previous_verdict`. A system that adds properties of its own keeps them across `systems init --refresh-bases`. A system's own field on a card is an `x_*` key (0.10.73: lower case after `x_`; the schema admits it, the sweep and the lint ignore it, a Base can read it, the verbs keep it, and `watchbill decide --set x_<key>=<value> CARD` writes one); every watchbill field stays closed. The key was `human_verdict` before 0.10.50; the schema still allows it for one release, `watchbill` reads it as `_human_verdict`, and `--refresh-bases` renames it on every card. `weight` is `quick` or `big` (0.10.50): a big card (a document under Track Changes review, a design or ADR approval, or one the seat marks big with `decide --weight big`) is presented in `documents to review`, a quick one in `new decisions` and then `returning decisions`; his drag between `new decisions` and `documents to review` sets it. `snooze_until` is the human's: an ISO date he may type on a snoozed card, on which `watchbill decisions sweep` brings it back as returning.

`processed_by`, `superseded_by` and `archived_to` (0.10.59; the copy editor's collection survey, section 10, proposals 2 and 4) are link fields an agent may set by hand: the commit or design section that absorbed a processed card, the card or record that replaces it, and where it went when archived. `watchbill decide` does not write them.
